# Activity Streams

As I'm sure many people were waiting for this, we've officially launched our initial documentation of the Activity Streams Experience! Developers, head on over to the [Stream Card Builder](/docs/AK-Stream-Card-Builder) page to check out the amazing automation we've put together to make your job stress free while continuing to deliver the excellent quality you've come to expect from Akumina.

When you're finished with that, why not take a trip to the [Custom Cards](/docs/AK-ActivityStream-CustomCard) page to get an idea of what you can do using the new Custom Stream Cards implementation? The intranet is your oyster, and Akumina is the shining pearl dedicated to lighting the path on your continued adventure of excellence!

Best not tarry long, these goods will only stay warm for so long!
