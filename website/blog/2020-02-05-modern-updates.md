### Sharepoint Modern and What Lies Beyond

While Microsoft has been busy improving and promoting Sharepoint Modern, we at Akumina have also been busy making sure we're not only supporting the latest and greatest but also meeting the ever-increasing needs of modern Intranets. From Modern's removal of Master Page support to the strict page layout constraints, Akumina is here to deliver the answers you've been looking for.

If you're interested in a similar experience as what Akumina provides in Classic, check out the [Akumina Single Page Application](/docs/Modern-SPA) page.
