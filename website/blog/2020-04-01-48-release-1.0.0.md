# Version 4.8

Version 4.8 of the Akumina Framework is launching soon. Aside from ordering pizza in celebration, we've decided to list the official patch notes over on the [Akumina V4.8 Overview](/docs/Akumina-Framework-4.8.0.0-Overview) page. Head over to check out some of the cool new features we've added, including Single Page Application official release as well as some additions to the base Foundation implementation and quality of life improvements to App Manager.

What are you waiting for? Let's get some of that Akumina 4.8 goodness!
