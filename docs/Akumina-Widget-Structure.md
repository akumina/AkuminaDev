### Overview


This article will detail the Akumina Widget structure and the default templating contained within. Explanation of terms and purposes of certain properties and files will also be documented within.

## The "Definition" property
This property will create the corrosponding widget definition within the Akumina implementation. Remember the widget definition is used as the 'configuration' for your widget. It is not inserted into any page, but rather sets the blue print for the instances of the widgets created.  Think of the defintion as the 'class' and an instance as the 'object' - You cannot create instances without the defintion.  The instances are what ends up being insert into the page.  Anytime you create a new instance, think of your instance as 'passing through' the definition.  Some of the properties, such as 'views' control which views are available when creating the instance, this helps enforce rules for your business users.

```json
"Definition": {
        "Name": "YourWidget", //Unique name for your widget
        "Class": "CustomerName.Widgets.YourWidget", // Akumina will create a new instance of this class and call the Init() method
        "ContentTypes": [], //array of content types to be imported into sharepoint - found in /contenttypes directory
        "Version": "", 
        "Dependencies": [], //array of other widgetnames to be loaded by getwidgetjs bundle, this allows for other module code to be used - IE you want to use the GenericListWidget code - the only way to inject the JS code is to set this value.  The framework will handle getting this module code from the getwidgetjs bundle. - see sample section below for more detail
        "Properties": [
            {
                "name": "propertyname",
                "friendlyname": "property friendly name",
                "value": "default value",
                "type": "string"
            },
            {
                "name": "propertyname2",
                "friendlyname": "property friendly name 2",
                "value": "default value 2",
                "type": "bool"
            }
        ],
        "Views": [
            {
                "Name": "view 1", //unique name used by instance
                "Path": "/Style%20Library/DigitalWorkPlace/Content/Templates/YourWidget/view1.html",
                "Id": "a04c9e8c-03d1-47a8-83c7-a9b942600f2d" //random guid
            },
            {
                "Name": "view 2", //unique name used by instance
                "Path": "/Style%20Library/DigitalWorkPlace/Content/Templates/YourWidget/view2.html",
                "Id": "f54c4053-9431-a2be-9922-651c15a24554" //random guid
            }
        ],
        "JS": {
            "Default": "/Style%20Library/DigitalWorkPlace/JS/widgets/yourwidget.js" //location in style library where widget module js gets deployed - the getwidgetJS bundle will return this if widget is detected on page
        }
}
```

### Dependencies Array for Definition

If you have a custom widget that requires the use of another widget.
A widget is just a class, the class is not available unless that class has been "injected" into the page - in the event you have a widget that is doing something like:

```javascript

   var control = new Akumina.AddIn.GenericListControlWidget();
   control.Init(this.listRequest);


```

You would add 'GenericListWidget' to the 'Dependencies' this so that Akumina.AddIn.GenericListControlWidget is defined automatically:

```json
{
  "Definition": {
    "Name": "CustomWidget",
    "Description": "CustomWidget",
    "Class": "Customer.Widgets.CustomWidget",
    "Dependencies": ["GenericListWidget"],

```

Without this feature the developer would be resonsible for making a call to the digitalworkplace.core.genericlistcontrolwidget.min.js on their own so that is defined prior to new'ing up that class.


### Available Property Types for Widget Defintions
This values can be used in the "type" field value  

| type |
| --- |
| int |
| string |
| bool |
| choice |
| json |
| listselector¹ |
| itemselector² |
| groupselector |

## The "Instance" property
```json
"Instances": [
        {
            "Name": "Your widget instance",
            "Description": "Your widfet instance description",
            "Icon": "fa fa-circle", //font awesome icon
            "Id": "b32c3fef-83d0-e48e-2519-55da67b8a3c6", //uniqueid for your widget
            "Properties": [
                {
                    "name": "propertyname",
                    "value": "actual value"
                },
                {
                    "name": "propertyname2",
                    "value": "actual value 2"
                }
            ],
            "SelectedView": "view 1", //view name from the definition - this is so we dont define paths twice
            "AvailableViews": ["view 2"],
            "HiddenFields": ["propertyname2"] //this property wont show for the user on the front end when changing properties
        }
    ],
```

## The "Options" property
```javascript
"Options": {
        "IsPartialDefinition": false, //when set to true the import process will only import the instance, most commonly used in subsites or deploying instances of OOB Akumina widgets, IE you dont have the full definition, but you want to deploy an instance, think Generic List Control
        "IsDashboardWidget": false
}
```
