## Project Structure Functionality

Alongside the update to Akumina Framework Version 4.8, the following npm packages have been updated:

* akumina-widget-builder @ 2.0.0

The major change in the update is the use of the **{AssetLibraryName}** token. This token is used to differentiate which asset library name is being used depending on the version. Classic will use **Style Library** whereas Modern will use **Akumina Library**. An example of the change is listed below:

```json
"Views": [
    // Version 4.8
    {
        "Name": "default",
        "Path": "/{AssetLibraryName}/DigitalWorkPlace/Content/Templates/GenericListWidget/default.html",
        "Id": "63db9f69-b64b-5af2-63b2-638864839723"
    }

    // Version 4.5
    {
        "Name": "default",
        "Path": "/Style%20Library/DigitalWorkPlace/Content/Templates/GenericListWidget/default.html",
        "Id": "63db9f69-b64b-5af2-63b2-638864839723"
    }
]
```

* generator-akumina @ 2.0.1

The major change in the update is the addition of a new variable in the **akumina.config.json** file. Because the new Site Deployer (bundled with the generator) scans the **widgetpackages** folder for widget folders instead of zip files, the config files need to be updated accordingly. The new **WidgetPackageDistPath** variable is now used to define where packaged widget bundles are being stored whereas the old **WidgetPackageDestinationPath** variable is now used to house the original built zip files.
Previously, the **WidgetPackageDestinationPath** held the value of the current **WidgetPackageDistPath** but the values have been swapped as a result of the inclusion of the new variable.

**Be sure to make sure the WidgetPackageVersion is set to 4.8.0.0 and that you are also using the new Akumina.SiteDeployer 4.8 version found here: https://github.com/akumina/SiteDeployer/releases**

Example:
```json
{
    "WidgetsSourcePath": "src/js/widgets",
    "WidgetPackageVersion": "4.8.0.0",
    "WidgetPackageDistPath": "sitedefinitions/MyCustomNamespace/WidgetPackages",
    "WidgetPackageDestinationPath": "dist/packages",
    "CDNAssetsPath": "sitedefinitions/MyCustomNamespace/CDNAssets",
    "Environments": [
        {
            "Name": "dev",
            "AppManagerUrl": "https://[appmanagerurl]",
            "AppManagerQueryKey": "[appmanagerquerykey]",
            "SharepointUrl": "https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/dev"
        }
    ]
}
```

Please ensure you have the appropriate versions of the listed npm packages to facilitate and make use of expanded functionality.
