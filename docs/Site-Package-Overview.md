# Overview
The Deployment Manager (or Site Creator) App is allows the creation of sites and/or deployment of artifacts within those sites. Here is an example of a site deployed using a site package, the foundation site:

These are called "Site Packages", and are available for selection via the deployment manager:

> Site packages can also deployed using continuous integration via a console app.

Each site package has properties defined, which allow the end user to enter the value in the process of creating or deploying a site. These properties can be simple types such as a textbox, checkbox, dropdown, etc, or more complex such as an image upload, as shown below:

The site package is a collection of steps that get executed by the Deployment Manager; those steps in turn execute instructions. It is a programmable framework using the SDK and for more information look at the SDK documentation [here](https://github.com/akumina/AkuminaDev/wiki/Deployment-Manager:-Custom-Site-Definition-Components).

# Site Package folders
The Site Package instructions are located in **_AppManager path_/SiteDefinitions/** - and inside each folder are the instructions needed for the common steps in the site packages.

> NOTE: not every site package will use all of the folders.
