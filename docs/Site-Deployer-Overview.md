# Site Deployer
This is a console app used for deploying Akumina bits into Sharepoint online. It can be used for local developer workstations or within VSTS / automated CI tooling. The same site package used within Site Creator can be used with the Site deployer, or vice versa. [Supported steps are below](#usage)
>**NOTE** - DO NOT use with Akumina 4.0 Site Collections - there is a seperate Site Deployer for 4.0 versions
